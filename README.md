This project simulates an autonomous vacuum cleaning bot in physical environment in pygame.
There were 2 algorithms implemented in this project:
1. straight line algorithm
2. optimized cleaning algorithm with dynamic programming



Run the simpleBot4_soln.py to see the simulation of the bot in action.
```
change the value of the variable "algo" in experiment() to switch between the 2 algorithms.
